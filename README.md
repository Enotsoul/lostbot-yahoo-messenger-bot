# Yahoo Messenger BOT in Java

**NOTE: This experimental and unmaintained.**

Developed in 2011

It used SQLIte and MYSQL. You could ask it for different things. You could authenticate and do various tasks:

. It could spy on someone for you.
. It supported basic Trivia.
. Searching google and retrieving an answer (deprecated since the API no longer works)
. Sens messages on behalf of you to other users
. Invite people to a channel 
. And other fun functions
. Support for ASCII art
- It queried GOOGLE for answers but removed the code since it now no longer works (it's been almost 7 years!)
